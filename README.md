## Introduction: Zillow and UT

  Zillow is a notoriously known website for its online real estate marketplace and service, such as Zillow Mortgage, Zillow Advice, and Zestimate. Real estate agents can sell their clients’ properties, buy or rent one for them. Zillow has also made the website usable for all users to perform differnet tasks on the platform, from searching houses in a neighborhood to refinance their property. Searching on Zillow comprises some features that are usually found in other real estate platforms. However, Zillow provides interactive options, such as a 3D tour, commuting estimation, and save the search. 
However, during the heuristic evaluation, I noticed that three tasks could be problematic for (senior) users and beneficial in testing the website’s usability. The target users were those who had heard about Zillow but never used it. With a focus on homepage and search tool, these tasks are as follows: 
> 1. Searching a neighborhood and narrowing down the search: 

In this task, I ask the user to search for Westwood (Los Angeles), then narrow it down to three bedrooms, three bathrooms, with AC, and a 1980-2010 build apartment.

> 2. Find a mortgage calculator from the homepage or search on the website. 

The second task is primarily emphasizing the lack of a search tool for the website. In a minimalistic move, Zillow tried to remove all unnecessary information (tabs, buttons, shapes) and bring attention to its giant city/neighborhood search box.

> 3. Getting the first result back

I found out that if a user Coming soon option from the homepage to narrow down the search result, the default result would not appear even if the user starts over from the homepage.

## Method

In this test, I used the observation method by recording the test session conducted in the participants’ chosen place where feels more comfortable. The ambiance was friendly. The participant decided to sit on the floor on a soft carpet while doing the test, a usual way for her when she routinely uses her device. The whole session was recorded, except for the part when the moderator (I) asked the background questions that contained identifiable data. The sound, screen, and the participant’s face were recorded. The mouse pointer is red and changes to blue when the participant does click. Due to cultural reasons, the moderator decided to release the interview here while the participant’s face is blurred. Because the recording software was installed on the moderator’s device, the participants had to use the device which was not entirely familiar with its mouse/trackpad. Nevertheless, it does not cause a significant issue, and it is believed that it did not significantly affect the overall result.

## Interview

## Result

  Like ethnography for an anthropologist, a usability test (UT) provides unique first-hand data about the field (software, website, etc.) where the research is being conducted. In the case of the UT that was conducted on Zillow, I tried to bring the environment closer to the natural everyday conditions of life. As mentioned earlier, the participant did three tasks where she felt comfortable, where she works with her devices on her everyday routine. Before the test started (not recorded), we had a brief conversation about how her day was and everything. When we started the test, I recognized that the trackpad of the test device had a different sensitivity than the participant’s device mouse pad. However, this test was not a big concern as she learned how to use it before doing the task. 
Three tasks were chosen for this test based on the website’s issues for a potential (senior) user. The first task asks to search Westwood on the website and narrow it down to a few criteria to test if the website is accessible for a person who has never used the website; specifically, if a user can go to the advanced search without difficulty. The participants easily did the search and found the result. However, she could not narrow down the result and did not notice that the result was not Westwood in Los Angeles while she has lived in the area for decades. It could be related to the insufficient information I provided during the test by asking her to search for Westwood and not specifying Westwood in Los Angeles. Instead of using the (advance) search tool, participants decided to read houses’ information. I could feel that the participant is worried about her ability to use a website like Zillow. She asked me to stop the recording for a minute and told me she feels she is not good with technology. I realized that I could emphasize more on the instruction, particularly on the section which says this is not testing your ability but how the design work for any user. It was also a cultural matter, keeping the face in front of others and not showing signs of weakness in the presence of someone who is not a family member. A possible solution for this issue would be a cultural-specific questionnaire in which sociocultural matters are considered. For example, the UT team can spend more time before the test with users or the target community to make the environment more familiar and familiar for both users and moderators. 
Besides the main search box for finding houses, Zillow does not provide other search buttons on the homepage to search the website material. In the second task, I thought it would be problematic for a user to find a Mortgage calculator on the website, and the tasks were designed based on the difficulty of finding the calculator or a search tool to look for it. However, the participant found the calculator in a few seconds, which made the other steps unnecessary. It shows that the test design did not consider other scenarios by establishing its base on the presumption that a user would be confused when she finds the website with no other search tool. It demonstrates how heuristic evaluation can affect the UT, as the second task was designed based on the heuristic evaluation results. 
To wrap up the result, I could personalize the interview and questionnaire by taking different scenarios into account. I also could spend more time with the participants before the test to see how comfortable she is with a device that is not hers. While the latter apparently did not affect the test result, the former observably influenced the outcome. For example, in the first task, Westwood in Los Angeles was assumed as the default search result, and the participant thought the website probably knew it because of her geolocation. The last point is that the participant seemingly decided not to spend more time to see if there is a way to work around the issue, such as narrowing down the search result or why she cannot see her first result anymore after clicking on Coming soon. As a result, the interview was short. I believe designing tasks with consideration of multiple scenarios would resolve this issue.
